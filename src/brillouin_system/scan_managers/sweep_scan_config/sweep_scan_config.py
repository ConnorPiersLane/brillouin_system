"""
Config for the in-out sweep scan (repeated find-measure-find cycles).

Same pattern as scan_managers/scanning_config: dataclass + TOML + a global
ThreadSafeConfig instance. Detection and motion parameters (speed, thresholds,
sample rate, min_samples_above, ...) are NOT duplicated here — the sweep scan
takes those from the shared axial ScanningConfig, so each crossing behaves
identically to the GUI reflection finder.
